# Hono Templates - MVC API Template

Hono Templates is a customizable Hono.js application template designed to help you kickstart your project. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and is written in TypeScript, making it suitable for building RESTful APIs.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is organized as follows:

- **src/controllers/**: Controllers that handle API requests.
- **src/models/**: Mongoose models for defining data structures.
- **src/routes/api/**: API route definitions.
- **src/config/**: Environment-specific configuration settings.
- **src/middlewares/**: Middleware functions for request processing.
- **src/services/**: Business logic services.
- **src/repository/**: Data access through repository classes.
- **src/utils/**: Utility functions for various tasks.
- **src/tests/**: Bun-test tests for testing the application.
